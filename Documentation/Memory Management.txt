Synergy OS uses amazingly simple memory management. Everything uses physical 
addresses, and paging is not enabled at all, due to the single-address-space 
requirements.

Basically we get given a list of free memory regions by the bootloader (GRUB).
We take out anything being used by the kernel or by boot modules, and the rest
is assigned to free memory, which is then used by malloc() and free() for other
kernel functions.
