system is a package.
system.Console is a static class.
system.File is a non-static class.

import system.Console; imports the class so we can use it's functions.

import system.File;
foo = new File;

import system.*; imports all the classes in system so that we can use them.

//In memory, a class' bytecode can be signed with a digital signature.

// We don't need to specify the entire object string, but we can if we want to.
		//system.console.printLine("Hello, world!");
		
		//String is a built-in type.
		//String foo = "world";
		
		
//A static class is one with no member variables. In this case, it's basically a wrapper for functions.

//A constructor. Always called for all objects. Does not need to be defined if empty. Acts as main function for program called from console. In which case, console initialises constructor's arguments from command line arguments. No number is returned, but errors can be thrown.
