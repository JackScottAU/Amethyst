Introduction:
=============
Synergy is a new operating system with the goal of bringing together all 
computers into a perfect cloud; sharing processing power and data storage, 
whilst still giving each user full control over their individual privacy and 
their data.

The Synergy platform will use a Java-like managed language and runtime to enable
cross-platform support, and to allow the power of all machines to be harnessed 
to their best advantage. A key goal of this language is to make support for 
threading commonplace amongst user-land programs, in order to harness the power 
of emerging multi-core machines.

The system is currently being developed for x86-based PCs, but additional 
platforms will be supported eventually. Support is planned not only for desktop 
and laptop systems, but also for tablets, smart phones, and other embedded 
devices.

Minimum System Requirements:
============================
  * Intel x86-based CPU with FPU
  * 8MiB RAM
  * CD-ROM drive
  * Keyboard
  * VGA-compatible Video card and Monitor
