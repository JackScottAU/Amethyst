My console driver is fairly simple. it will have video specific functions in Video.c and Video.h, with prefix Vid
Keyboard functions will be in Keyboard.c and the respective Header file, with prefix Key
Serial functions (you guessed it) will be in Serial.c and Serial.h, with prefix Ser

Then my wrapper functions will be in Console.c, with a system-wide include file in the includes directory. They will have no prefix. They will choose what other functions to run depending on the current chosen device(s).
